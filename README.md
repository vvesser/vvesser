- 👋 Hi, I’m @vvesser
- 👀 I’m interested in our global family, (and my little personal one) computer programming, advanced materials, sustainability and my wonderful partner Pauline
who is more than family and a part of me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git! Also, Python, html, css, Java, JavaScript, SQL and everything I can about computers and computer languages.
I am also interested in Space exploration, human equality and a sustainable future here on Earth and everywhere we go. Truthfully I have more interests 
than I have time for but most of my major interests are above.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my web site dedicated to saving our greatest shared asset, Earth! I have a domain and a very basic intro
@ 2savetheearth.com . My above interests are being developed to meet that goal and to unite everyone who is working on the same! 
- 📫 How to reach me. vvesser@yahoo.com and I may not see your message because I have a billion junk mails a day from different people who could
get everything done by uniting! Vince 360-499-9945
I am just finishing up my last two major classes and then I should hit the ground running!!!
